# Large-Scale Linguistic Mimicry: Evaluating Persuasion Efficiency of Large Language Models

The code in this repository is the supplemental code for Isabella Duan's MA thesis at the University of Chicago.

The code is written in Python 3.9.7 and all of its dependencies can be installed by running the following in the terminal (with the `requirements.txt` file included in this repository):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can import the `metrics` module located in this repository to reproduce our analysis of the 9 linguistic mimicry metrics:


```python
import metrics
```
