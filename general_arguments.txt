True:

["As the world rapidly evolves, automation becomes increasingly integral to business efficiency. McDonald's, a global leader in fast food, is already leveraging technological advancements in various capacities. Upgraded kiosks, mobile ordering, and increasingly automated kitchens are standard in many locations, hinting at a future fully automated restaurant. Given the fast-paced progression of AI and robotics technology, coupled with a relentless pursuit of operational efficiency and customer convenience, it's compelling to argue that the first fully automated McDonald's in the US is not just a possibility but a likely reality before 2030.",
 "Considering Iran's determined pursuit of nuclear energy and advancements, coupled with international tensions and weakening sanctions, it's plausible the country could possess a nuclear weapon by 2030. This is considering the stealthy progress attained despite joint agreements to moderate Iran's nuclear program, and its notorious history of non-compliance to international nuclear pacts. Furthermore, the continuous political instability in the Middle East region may fuel Iran's resolve in this direction. As changes in global politics continue to evolve, the probability of Iran achieving this development by 2030 should not be underestimated.",
 "Embracing solar power as the planet's primary renewable energy source by 2030 is inevitable. Solar technology advancements are exorbitant, with efficiency rates consistently augmenting and costs rapidly plunging. The sun's energy is profoundly abundant and inexhaustible, offering a limitless supply of power. As governments restrict carbon emissions and investors divest from fossil fuels, renewable competition diminishes, paving the path for solar dominance. By 2030, solar energy's advantages in cost, efficiency, abundance, and sustainability will render it the undisputed leader in renewable energy consumption.",
 "With advancements in medical technology and healthcare, longevity is consistently increasing. Genetic research and personalized medicine are revealing ways to extend our lifespan by slowing ageing or curing age-related diseases. Moreover, healthy lifestyles, combined with promising breakthroughs in biotech, might make it possible for someone born before 2001 to live up to 150 years. The opportunity to live longer, healthier lives is closer than we've ever imagined."]


False:

["While advancements in technology and AI have propelled the automation industry forward, the full automation of McDonald's within the United States before 2030 remains unlikely. For one, the feasibility of full automation sidelines significant aspects like customer service and quality control, elements integral to McDonald's operations. Additionally, potential legal battles concerning workers' rights or malfunctions may further delay the conversion to complete automation. Lastly, the need for technological adaptation across all branches may prove time-consuming and cost-heavy, pushing the date beyond 2030.",
 "Given Iran's existing compliance with the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) and the stringent surveillance by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), it is implausible for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon before 2030. The nation's re-commitment to the JCPOA and open collaboration with international agencies ensures the peaceful nature of their nuclear program. Furthermore, their economic adversity and international sanctions heavily limit the resources required for such an endeavor. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that Iran will possess a nuclear weapon within this decade.",
 "While solar power is an increasingly popular renewable energy, it's highly unlikely to dominate this sector before 2030. Expensive installation costs, dependency on weather conditions for efficiency, and profound storage challenges prevent universal adoption. Furthermore, competition from other viable, renewable energy sources like wind and hydropower, that are more reliable and cost-effective, means solar power's dominance isn't assured in the imminent future. Therefore, the potential for solar power to rule over other renewable energies by 2030 is filled with uncertainty.",
 'While advancements in medicine and technology improve life expectancy, it is improbable that someone born before 2001 will live to be 150. Current global average life expectancy is approximately 72.6 years, a stark contrast to 150. In fact, the oldest recorded age is 122 years. Achieving the age of 150 would require a drastic, unprecedented leap in science, unlikely to occur within the lifetime of those born before 2001. Furthermore, genetic factors, lifestyle and environmental conditions also limit human lifespan. Therefore, living to 150 remains a distant possibility.']
